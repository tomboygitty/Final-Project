# Project Name
Munch Good

## Description
This is an app designed to help teach kids about healthy food choices. It was built with React, Node and Express.
## Motivation
Our team wanted to make a health-tracking app with a focus on educating its users about diabetes. We re-tooled the concept to educate children about good diet choices.
## Results
The app is largely successful for our limited scope. User credentials are stored locally to track the amount of each nutrient that have been consumed. A variety of foods show how different choices can affect one's overall health.
## Individual Responsibilities
`Stephen Fox` - Project Manager, General Concept, Graphic Design, Front-End<br />
`Anissa B` - Content Manager, General Concept, Presentation, Styling<br />
`Tom Elliott` - Back-End, General Concept, Repo Management/Deployment
### Challenges
The biggest challenges in this project were creating the right file structure/planning and implementing an unfamiliar authentication system (Passport). Zeroing in on the specific routing problems for implementing Passport authentication proved to be too difficult, so we opted to store data locally.
## Improvements
Have a fully functional database to store user credentials and stats with working authentication. Also, have a section for general health/diet tips, whether locally generated or pulled from an API.
